# Login page
It's a personal project that i did to practice, the website is made with HTML & CSS and is intended to be a Login page.
<br>
The website is responsive, using flexbox methods in CSS.
<br>
My goal with this is to learn and improve more about website design.

**If you want, you can give feedback on how the site turned out or give me some tips, I will be grateful. Thank you ðŸ˜€**
